# 🗂️ Task Manager Web App 📝

A lightweight and user-friendly task manager built with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It is still a work in progress, so not everything has been built yet. More features will be added soon.
Right now, it includes the basic functionalities: adding and deleting a task.
The style.css is very simple for now, but I will improve it later once the script is finalized and I’ve thought more about the final design.

## What It Does

- Add, complete, and delete tasks easily  
- Saves your tasks in the browser using **localStorage**  
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile  
- Smooth CSS animations for a polished feel  

## Why This Project?

It’s perfect for learning how to build real web apps from scratch; Mastering JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and browser storage without relying on external libraries or frameworks.
